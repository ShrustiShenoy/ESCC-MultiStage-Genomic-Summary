# ESCC-MultiStage-Genomic-Summary
This repository contains Python scripts for **Copy Number Variation (CNV)** and **Simple Nucleotide Variation (SNV)** analysis across multiple stages of **Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)** samples. The scripts automate parsing, summarization, and report generation into Excel files for downstream analysis.

##  Features
- Batch processing across multiple cancer stages.
- CNV and SNP extraction, summarization, and visualization.
- Combined and per-stage summary reports in Excel format.
- Identification of top mutated genes.
- Mutation classification distribution.
- Error logging for failed files.

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `openpyxl`
